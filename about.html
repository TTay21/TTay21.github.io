 <!--  Now add the following script to create a slicknav (mobile) version of your navigation menu, then attach it to an empty nav element you'll add before your navigation menu in your HTML. In this case, I've given my navigation menu the .nav_menu class; insert the class attached to your own navigation menu where you see .nav_menu in the following script. In the HTML, you'll see I've added an empty nav element just before .nav_menu and given it the ID #mobilemenu. That ID appears in the script below, too. Insert the class or ID name you've attached to your empty nav element where you see #mobilemenu in the following script. -->

          <h2> Our Roots</h2>
          <p>We’ve all learnt that “giant trees grow from small seeds”, so I have always felt the need to help those who had 
            the drive to succeed. Even as I reflect on the days when I overheard my peers complain about the lack of support 
            they received when starting their businesses or witnessing young adults in inner city neighborhoods steer into 
            the wrong direction of life, I knew I wanted to help millennials achieve their goals. Leading with Lee Magazine 
            was created to give aspiring and seasoned young adults a platform to learn, grow, and have a voice.</p>
